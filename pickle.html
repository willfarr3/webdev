            <li>full sun</li>
            <li>well drained sandy loam with a soil ph of 5.6-6.2 is ideal</li>

    <p>start with rich, organic soil. apply a balenced fertilizer (10-10-10) at a rate of 10 pounds per 100 squere feet. fertilize again after renovation of june bearers or second harvest of day nuetral or everbearing types. do not over fertilize or you will have an exsessive leaf growth and poor flowering. do not fertilize late in season in colder climates to prevent new growth that will be damaged by frost.</p>
